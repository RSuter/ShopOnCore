# ShopOnCore

Sample solution which shows how to 

- implement ASP.NET Core (web api) and .NET Core (message processor) microservices with .NET Core 2.1+
- package and run them and the required services (rabbitmq and redis) with Docker and Docker Compose
- and write tests which can act as integration and E2E tests (with the usage of DI and TestServer)

There will be blog posts based on this solution on https://blog.rsuter.com
